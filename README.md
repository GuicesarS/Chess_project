# ♟️ Chess Game in C#

This project is a console-based chess game developed in C# with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and good software design practices. It was created as a study project to reinforce principles such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**, while implementing the full logic of a classic chess game.
